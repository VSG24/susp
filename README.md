## ðŸ¤šðŸ›‘ SUSP - suspend connections and don't become suspicious

#### Have you ever wanted to restrict visiting a website on your browser to only when you are using a VPN?
#### Perhaps you want to browse an online banking system when you are travelling abroad or maybe a crypto exchange without KYC?

### That's all fine and well until the moment you forget to turn on the VPN and the system blocks/suspends/flags your account!

Most VPN software has a kill-switch function however this feature useually blocks all connections unless the VPN connection is established and this may not be exactly what you need.

Using SUSP extension you can limit visiting a website to only when your IP is detected to be from a specific country that you choose beforehand.
This way you can ensure that you are always browsing the website from the same country, thus decreasing the chance of your account being flagged.


You can install this extension in all Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Opera.
Be sure that `Developer mode` is enabled in extension management page in your browser, click `Load unpacked` and choose the folder where you cloned this repository.
